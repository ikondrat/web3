# Simple DB Store

## Overview
The Simple DB Store provides persistent storage for blockchain events, monitoring data, and alert history. For the MVP, this is a straightforward database implementation focused on reliability and ease of deployment rather than advanced scalability.

## Role in Architecture
- Stores processed blockchain events for historical reference
- Maintains alert history and state
- Persists monitoring configuration and rules
- Provides data for potential future analytics and reporting
- Enables stateful monitoring across application restarts

## Key Functionalities
- Schema management for structured blockchain data
- CRUD operations for events, alerts, and configuration
- Basic querying capabilities for alert history
- Data retention policies (time-based expiry)
- Lightweight indexing for common query patterns

## Technical Implementation Options
- SQLite for single-instance deployments (simplest option for MVP)
- PostgreSQL for more robust production deployments
- MongoDB for schema flexibility with JSON documents
- TypeORM or Prisma for database abstraction layer
- Optimized schema design for blockchain event storage

## Data Models
- Events: Processed blockchain events with metadata
- Alerts: Generated alerts with severity, status, and context
- Configurations: Monitoring rules and notification settings
- Subscriptions: Active event subscriptions and filtering preferences
- System: Application status and operational metrics

## Storage Strategy
- Structured and normalized schema for efficient querying
- Periodic pruning of old events based on retention policy
- Optimized indexes for common query patterns
- Separation of hot data (recent) from cold data (archived)

## Performance Considerations
- Batch writes for high-volume event processing
- Indexing strategy focused on alert retrieval performance
- Lazy loading for large event payloads
- Connection pooling for concurrency management

## Future Extensibility
- Designed to be replaceable with more scalable solutions in the future
- Clean abstraction layer to minimize migration efforts
- Schema versioning to support upgrades
