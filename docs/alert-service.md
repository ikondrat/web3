# Alert Service

## Overview
The Alert Service is responsible for managing alert generation, processing, and routing based on events identified by the Event Processor. It determines the severity, format, and destination of notifications for different alert scenarios.

## Role in Architecture
- Receives alert triggers from the Event Processor
- Applies additional context and formatting to alerts
- Manages alert severity and classification
- Routes alerts to appropriate notification channels
- Handles alert deduplication and rate-limiting
- Maintains alert state and history

## Key Functionalities
- Alert enrichment with additional context
- Alert prioritization and severity assignment
- Alert grouping and correlation
- Alert template rendering for different notification formats
- Routing logic for directing alerts to appropriate notification channels
- Rate limiting and deduplication to prevent alert storms
- Maintaining alert state (new, acknowledged, resolved)

## Technical Implementation
- Rule-based system for alert classification
- Template engine for consistent alert formatting
- In-memory caching for deduplication
- Queue-based processing for handling alert bursts
- Configurable routing rules for notification dispatch

## Alert Types Examples
- Critical: Validator slashing events
- High: Large balance transfers
- Medium: Governance proposals reaching threshold
- Low: Regular network statistics updates

## Configuration Options
- Alert templates for different notification channels
- Severity thresholds for different event types
- Rate limiting parameters
- Notification routing rules
- Alert grouping settings

## Extensibility
- Pluggable architecture for adding new alert processors
- Custom alert formatters for different contexts
- Configurable alert routing logic
- Support for alert correlation across multiple events

## Integration Points
- Receives alert triggers from Event Processor
- Sends formatted alerts to Notification Service
- May access DB Store for additional context information when enriching alerts
