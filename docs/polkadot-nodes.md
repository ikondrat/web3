# Polkadot Nodes

## Overview
Polkadot Nodes represent the actual blockchain network that our monitoring solution connects to. These are the core infrastructure components of the Polkadot network that maintain the blockchain state, validate transactions, and produce blocks.

## Role in Architecture
- Serves as the primary data source for our monitoring system
- Exposes JSON-RPC endpoints for programmatic access to blockchain data
- Provides real-time updates through websocket subscriptions
- Maintains the authoritative state of the blockchain

## Interaction Points
- Communicates directly with our Polkadot.js API Client through JSON-RPC or WebSocket protocols
- Provides blockchain events, state data, and transaction information

## Technical Considerations
- Can be accessed via public nodes (for development/testing) or private nodes (for production)
- May have rate limiting constraints when using public nodes
- Network reliability impacts monitoring system performance
- Different node types (archive nodes, full nodes) provide different levels of historical data access

## Implementation Notes
- For the MVP, we'll connect to existing public Polkadot nodes rather than running our own
- We'll need to implement connection retry logic and fallback mechanisms for reliability
- Consider caching frequently accessed data to reduce node request load
