# Notification Service

## Overview
The Notification Service is responsible for delivering alerts and notifications to end-users through various channels. It handles the formatting, delivery, and tracking of notifications generated by the Alert Service.

## Role in Architecture
- Receives formatted alerts from the Alert Service
- Manages delivery channels for notifications
- Handles notification formatting for different channels
- Ensures reliable delivery of critical notifications
- Tracks notification delivery status
- Implements retry mechanisms for failed deliveries

## Key Functionalities
- Channel-specific notification formatting
- Delivery to multiple notification channels (email, SMS)
- Notification batching to prevent flooding
- Delivery confirmation and tracking
- Retry logic for failed notification attempts
- Rate limiting to prevent notification storms
- Template rendering for consistent notification appearance

## Technical Implementation
- Queue-based processing for asynchronous delivery
- Pluggable notification providers
- Templating engine for notification content
- Delivery status tracking
- Health monitoring for notification channels

## Supported Notification Channels (MVP)
- Email: For detailed notifications with context and links
- SMS: For urgent, high-priority alerts requiring immediate attention
- Webhook: For integration with external systems (optional for MVP)

## Notification Templates
- Alert notifications with severity indicators
- Daily/weekly summary reports (future extension)
- System status updates
- Custom templates for different event types

## Delivery Strategy
- Immediate delivery for critical alerts
- Batched delivery for lower priority notifications
- Escalation paths for unacknowledged critical alerts
- Configurable quiet hours and notification preferences

## Resilience Features
- Persistent queue for notifications during outages
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing notification channels
- Fallback channels for critical alerts
- Monitoring of notification delivery performance

## Future Extensibility
- Designed to easily add new notification channels
- Support for mobile push notifications
- Integration with messaging platforms (Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Interactive notifications with action buttons
